<h1>100+ monolingual speech recognizers, one per language</h1>
<p class="tag">We fine-tune Whisper-large-v3 into a separate model for each of 102 FLEURS languages, with two recipes: plain fine-tuning (SFT) and full fine-tuning with a native tokenizer (FFT). This site is a short technical overview of the project: the two recipes, why the tokenizer matters, and what the models achieve.</p>

!!! note "How to read the SOTA counts"
    "Lowest CER among open systems" means the best of SFT or FFT (picked per language on validation, never on test) beats Omni-1B/7B, MMS-1B, Qwen3-ASR, and Cohere on CER. We report it on FLEURS-test (31) and on the combined FLEURS + CommonVoice set (41).

## The two recipes

FFT's advantage comes from its tokenizer. Whisper's tokenizer was built for English-heavy data, so it splits other languages into many small pieces. FFT trains a native tokenizer that keeps whole morphemes. That one change makes FFT more accurate, and it also makes decoding faster.

<figcaption>Decode latency is token count times time-per-token. Whisper-ZS and SFT share a tokenizer and emit the same number of tokens, so they tie. FFT's native tokenizer emits fewer, so it finishes first.</figcaption>

## Where to start

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   __Technical overview__

    What BuzzASR is, and how the two recipes (SFT and FFT) differ.

    [Read the overview →](overview.md)

-   __The tokenizer__

    Why a native tokenizer helps, and a bug worth knowing about.

    [Tokenizer →](tokenizer.md)

-   __Results__

    How accurate the models are, and why FFT decodes faster.

    [See results →](results.md)

-   __Models__

    All 102 per-language weights are live on Hugging Face under the BuzzASR org.

    [Get the models →](models.md)

</div>

All 102 models are available now on Hugging Face under the [**BuzzASR** organization](https://huggingface.co/BuzzASR) — one model per language. See [Models](models.md).
